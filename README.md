# IVADO Labs - DS Assessment

## Executive Summary

This project showcases my technical and analytical skills through the completion of a comprehensive data science assessment provided by IVADO Labs. It required performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developing predictive models to generate demand forecasts for use in an inventory management solution.

Leveraging my primary proficiency in R, I conducted a detailed EDA and built an initial forecasting model using established time-series techniques. To demonstrate flexibility and broaden the solutionâ€™s applicability, I then implemented an alternative forecasting approach in Python, allowing for a direct comparison between two differents forecasting models with their pros and cons.

## Key Objectives

1.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.  Data Preparation and Modeling
